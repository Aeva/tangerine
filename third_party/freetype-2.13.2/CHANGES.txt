CHANGES BETWEEN 2.13.1 and 2.13.2 (2023-Aug-25)

  I. MISCELLANEOUS

  - Better support for CFF2 variation fonts.

  - TrueType interpreter  version 38 (also known  as 'Infinality') has
    been removed.

  - Improved OpenVMS support.


CHANGES BETWEEN 2.13.0 and 2.13.1 (2023-Jun-24)

  I. MISCELLANEOUS

  - New function  `FT_Get_Default_Named_Instance` to get the  index of
    the default named instance of an OpenType Variation Font.

  - A new load flag `FT_LOAD_NO_SVG` to make FreeType ignore glyphs in
    an 'SVG ' table.

  - New  function  `FT_GlyphSlot_AdjustWeight`  to  adjust  the  glyph
    weight either  horizontally or  vertically.  This  is part  of the
    `ftsynth.h` header file, which is  still considered to be in alpha
    stage.

  - TrueType interpreter  version 38 (also known  as 'Infinality') has
    been deactivated; the value  of `TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_38` is now
    the same as `TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_40`.

  - Updated OpenVMS support.

  - The  base  API  documentation  has  been  modularized  for  easier
    handling.

  - Switching named instances on and  off in Variation Fonts was buggy
    if the design coordinates didn't change.

  - `ftbench`  has a  new  command-line option  `-a`  to apply  design
    coordinates.

  - `ftview` can now flip SVG rendering on and off using the 'Z' key.

  - In  `ftmulti` it  is  now possible  to toggle  the  fill rule  and
    overlap flag  used for  rendering glyphs using  the 'F3'  and 'F4'
    keys,  respectively.   Toggling  the anti-aliased  mode  has  been
    changed to the 'TAB' key.


CHANGES BETWEEN 2.12.1 and 2.13.0 (2023-Feb-09)

  I. IMPORTANT CHANGES

  - The demo program `ftinspect` has  been completely updated and much
    enhanced.  It now  combines the functionality of  almost all other
    graphical FreeType  demo programs into a  single application based
    on the Qt framework.  This was Charlie Jiang's GSoC 2022 project.

  - The 'COLR' v1 API is now considered as stable.

  III. MISCELLANEOUS

  - For  OpenType  Variable Fonts,  `avar`  table  format 2.0  is  now
    supported.  The code was contributed by Behdad Esfahbod.

    Note that this is an extension supported on recent Apple platforms
    and by HarfBuzz, but not yet in the OpenType standard!  See

      https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/avar2.md

    for the specification.  To deactivate it, define the configuration
    macro 'TT_CONFIG_OPTION_NO_BORING_EXPANSION'.

  - A new API  `FT_GlyphSlot_Slant` to slant a glyph by  a given angle
    has been added.   Note that this function is  part of `ftsynth.h`,
    which is still considered to be in alpha stage.

  - TrueType interpreter version 38  (also known as 'Infinality') that
    was first introduced about 10 years  ago in FreeType 2.4.11 is now
    deprecated and slated to be removed in the next version.  TrueType
    interpreter version 40 has been FreeType's default version for six
    years now and provides an excellent alternative.  This is the last
    FreeType     version     with    TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_38     and
    TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_40 treated differently.

  - The  only  referenced  but never  documented  configuration  macro
    `FT_CONFIG_OPTION_NO_GLYPH_NAMES` has been removed.

  - The `ftbench` demo  program got a new command line  option `-e` to
    set a charmap index.

  - Specifying  a point  size is  now optional  for the  demo programs
    `ftgrid`, `ftmulti`,  `ftstring`, and  `ftview`.  If not  given, a
    default size is used.

  - For  `ftgrid`,  `ftstring`, and  `ftview`,  option  `-e` now  also
    accepts a numeric value to set a charmap index.

  - In  `ftstring`, it  is  now  possible to  set  the displayed  text
    interactively by pressing the 'Enter' key.

  - `ftmulti` can now handle up to 16 design axes.

  - To  avoid  reserved identifiers  that  are  globally defined,  the
    auto-hinter  debugging   macros  (which  are  only   available  if
    `FT_DEBUG_AUTOFIT` is defined)

    ```
    _af_debug_disable_horz_hints
    _af_debug_disable_vert_hints
    _af_debug_disable_blue_hints
    _af_debug_hints
    ```

    have been renamed to

    ```
    af_debug_disable_horz_hints_
    af_debug_disable_vert_hints_
    af_debug_disable_blue_hints_
    af_debug_hints_
    ```

  - The internal  zlib library was  updated to version  1.2.13.  Note,
    however, that  FreeType is *not* affected  by CVE-2022-37434 since
    it doesn't use the `inflateGetHeader` function.
