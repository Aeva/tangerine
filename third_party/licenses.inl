		"  FreeType Project.\n"
		"\n"
		"  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and\n"
		"  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license\n"
		"  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n"
		"  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n"
		"\n"
		"  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n"
		"  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n"
		"  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n"
		"  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n"
		"\n"
		"    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\n"
		"      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n"
		"\n"

		"      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n"
		"\n"
		"    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\n"
		"      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n"
		"      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n"

		"  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\n"
		"  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n"
